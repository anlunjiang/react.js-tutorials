# React States

## Buttons

In HTML there are button tags - same with JSX in React - but the listener is easier to implement:

```javascript
<button onClick={() => console.log("Clicked!")}></button>

// Naming Convention handler suffix - meaning this function is attached to an event
const clickHandler = () => {
  console.log("Clicked! My man!")
}

<button onClick={clickHandler}>Change Title</button>
```

The onClick requires a function - either on the fly or passing an existing imported one over. Notice we dont execute the
function - we only point or reference it

## React Sequence of Events

React will first read all your JSX code in components - and calls it all before translating to DOM and displaying it

This only happens once - so for changing events - like buttons - React needs to implement state.

```javascript

import {useState} from "react"
//function provided by the react library - to define values, where changes to these
// values should result in the component func being called again

const [title, setTitle] = useState(props.title)
// This is a REACT HOOK - they all start with "use" and must be called inside component 
// functions - and not in nested functions - root of component func

setTitle("Updated");
// This function itself will set the value and managed by react
// This will tell react to re initialise the component function
```

useState actually returns an Array - first value the variable itself, and the second is the updating function!

* Note that even though you can put state for a component. This state is actually only on a per state instant basis - so
  if you have multiple of the same component- they all have their own states as a result
* The hook will just re-instantiate the component when you update - and read the latest value from the state change
  previously

## User Inputs

You can listen to input from HTML tags:

```javascript
const [enteredTital, setEnteredTitle] = useState("");
const titleChangeHandler = (event) => {
  setEnteredTitle(event.target.value)
}
<input type="text" onChange={titleChangeHandler}/>
```

This will detect any title change to the input box - any keystroke.

* Now, when you listen to events - you get "event" which describes the event - this is what is looks like

```
SyntheticBaseEvent {
  _reactName: 'onChange',
  _targetInst: null,
  type: 'change',
  nativeEvent: InputEvent,
  target: input
  â€¦
}
target: input
  value: A
timeStamp: 44110.59999999404

```

* Important to note is the target.value = input
* You can have multiple state calls that are independent of each other

```javascript
  const [userInput, setUserInput] = useState({
  enteredTital: "",
  enteredAmount: "",
  enteredDate: "",
})

const titleChangeHandler = (event) => {
  setEnteredTitle(event.target.value)
  setUserInput({
    ...userInput,
    enteredTital: event.target.value
  })
}

const titleChangeHandler = (event) => {
  setUserInput((prevState) => {
    return {...prevState, enteredTital: event.target.value}
  });
};
// this would work - but can be better:
// React schedules state updates - so with the 1st method you may be
// updating from an outdated state
// The new method always retrieves the latest state 
```

One thing you can do is make only one state object for a component

- as hashmaps - can be cleaner

## Submitting on Forms

If a button of type submit, is inside a form tag - you can have a listener on the form tag itself

* Note that default behaviour is that the form will refresh the page
    * Since it will send a request to the server
* This default behaviour is overrided by

```javascript
const submitHandler = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const expenseData = {
    title: enteredTitle,
    amount: enteredAmount,
    date: new Date(enteredDate),
  };
  console.log(expenseData);
};

<form onSubmit={submitHandler}>
```

## Two-way binding

* Not just listening for imputs - but we pass a new value back into the input

```javascript
const [enteredTitle, setEnteredTitle] = useState("");
const titleChangeHandler = (event) => {
  setEnteredTitle(event.target.value)
};
<input type="text" value={enteredTitle} onChange={titleChangeHandler}>
  // parse the value input - once form is submitted - this will
  // change to whatever the value object is
```

## Parsing data from child to parent

You can parse data back up by creating your custom props:

```javascript
const NewExpense = () => {
  const saveExpenseDataHandler = (enteredExpenseData) => {
    const expenseData = {
      ...enteredExpenseData,
      id: Math.random().toString()
    };
    console.log(expenseData);
  };
  return (
    <div className="new-expense">
      <ExpenseForm onSaveExpenseData={saveExpenseDataHandler}/>
    </div>
  )
}

const submitHandler = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const expenseData = {
    title: enteredTitle,
    amount: enteredAmount,
    date: new Date(enteredDate),
  };
  props.onSaveExpenseData(expenseData) // passes data back up
  setEnteredTitle("");
  setEnteredAmount("");
  setEnteredDate("");
};
```
